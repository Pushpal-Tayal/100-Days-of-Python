# 100 Days of Python

I was introduced to python in the latter years of my undergraduate, but I really got into the implementation of coding projects during my management consulting job- wherein I tried to automate multiple workstreams in a purely non-technical environment. 

This repository contains all the projects from my 100-Days-of-Python Challenge. Hope you enjoy these mini projects :)
